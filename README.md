RoaringBitmap [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lemire/RoaringBitmap.png)](https://travis-ci.org/lemire/RoaringBitmap)
=============

Bitsets, also called bitmaps, are commonly used as fast data structure.
Unfortunately, they can use too much memory. To compensate, we often use
compressed bitmaps.

Roaring bitmaps are compressed bitmaps which tend to outperform conventional
compressed bitmaps such as WAH, EWAH or Concise. In some instances, it can
be hundreds of times faster and it often offers significantly better compression.

Code sample
-------------
        
        import org.roaringbitmap.*;
        
        //...
        
        RoaringBitmap rr = new RoaringBitmap.bitmapOf(1,2,3,1000);
        RoaringBitmap rr2 = new RoaringBitmap();
        for(int k = 4000; k<4255;++k) rr2.add(k);
        
        RoaringBitmap rror = RoaringBitmap.or(rr, rr2);
